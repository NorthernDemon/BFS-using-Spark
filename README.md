==============

Acknowledgment
-------

Sequential version of the BFS algorithm and data sets are taken from the book [Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)

Introduction
-------

Parallel Breadth-first search algorithm for undirected Graph processing using Spark

Installation
-------
Requirements: *JDK 7*, *Maven*, *Spark*

Configure service parameters in **service.properties** file.

####Run with IDE

Add the libraries from **sequential-libs** folder to your classpath.

Clean-install application with Maven
> mvn clean install

Start the master node using the following command
